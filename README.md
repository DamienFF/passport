# Passport
## Experimental. 

Passport is an easy to use Authentication library for Phoenix 1.3.

Passport is rewritten to make use of the context design pattern of Phoenix 1.3.

Passport organises the code in your project in the directory `lib/your_app/auth`

## Installation and Usage

  1. Add passport to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:passport, git: "https://github.com/opendrops/passport.git"}]
        end

  2. `$ mix do deps.get, compile`

  3. `$ mix passport.setup`

  4. Follow the instruction displayed on screen.


## State of development

This project is currently under development. Though it works, there are a lot of scope for improvement and not thoroughly tested. My goal is to make Passport a solid library for authentication. See the issues queues for the list of tasks to be done.
